node index.js ----starts server

Start your server and try to change the Hello World message in index.js, save the 
file, and refresh the page. 
You'll notice that the message does not change. Let's change that behavior by adding
Nodemon to watch for changes.

Open package.json and find the following line:

"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
}

We don't actually need the "test" script. Delete it and replace it with the following code so that your 
scripts line looks like this:

"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}

Running npm run start will accomplish the same result as before. However, 
if you instead run npm run dev, you'll notice that the server will watch for changes 
and log a success message. If you try the same thing as before - having your server
 running while changing the "Hello World" message - you'll see Nodemon
 will stop and restart the server for you. Once you refresh the web page your changes will be reflected!
